To set up the Server manager when you want to start setting up the Server 
or after doing reverting with the snapchat(Please always remeber to snapchat when you want to prepare the Server)

Set up the two Adapters(one is for NAT,External network(ISP cloud)
the internet outside(we put the correct Public Ip-address and i.e carefully not mess with it)
while the other Adapter(where we put the correct Internal network private Ip-address 
and from it calculate the correct Subnet-mask to use or put)is for the internal network of the Organisation
and thatÂ´s where we do the following configurations:   

1. Configure the Static Ipv4 Address (Host IP Address) on the private interface(for example it can also be 
configured with last usable Ipv4 address in the network, if asked to)

2. Rename the Server (any name e.g "dc1" for the server computer and e.g "client1" for the window 10 computer)
user1password or also 2015P@ssword are used for the clent whhile Fbassey17 for the server.

3. Install ADDS(Active Directory Domain Services) Role

4. Promote the Server to a domain

5. Install and configure DHCP(Also configure Dhcp scope for it 
(the Default gateway ip-address and the DNS ip-address is the same as the server Ip-address, 
i used it for the requirement of this assignment))

6. Join client to the domain
(after doing this and check the client computer to see if it have been connected to the domain
then prepare a powerShell script to create users,groups,OUs(department),
and to put the users to their respective OUs(departments))

7. Remote desktop(go to the client computer(window 10) and in the run search type local users and groups. 
select group,then select remote desktop users and click add on the dialog box that will appear  )
